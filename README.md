# Spectral Coherence and the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository presents the **geometric and spectral reformulation** of the Riemann Hypothesis, proposed by **Diego Muguet de MagalhÃ£es**, independent researcher from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The central claim of this work is:

> **RH â‡” Ï„(N) = 0 for all N > 0**

Where Ï„(N) is the torsion derived from a vector wave model constructed via the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The analysis reveals that if the oscillatory vector structure (FOR(N)) maintains global angular coherence, then all zeros must lie on the critical line.
